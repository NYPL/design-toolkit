### Compiling SCSS to CSS with Gulp or SASS CLI
1. To view, edit and complie `sass` to `css`:
  
    a. For `gulp`: Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed and up to date. From the root of the project run `npm i`. This will install the `gulp` dependencies.
    - Once `gulp` is installed, from the root, run `gulp`. This will compile your `scss` files to `css` and place them in the correct directory.
    - You can choose to run `gulp watch`, this command will actively watch the correct directory and complie files on save.

    b. Alternately you can run / compile `sass` directly (no Gulp required), via its CLI.
    - From the root of the project run: `sass --watch sass:css/docs`.

2. Have a milkshake. ðŸ¥›
